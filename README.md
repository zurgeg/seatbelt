# Save
~~For some reason, it seems cartridges come with saves. If there is no save on the cart, we recieve an error known as Error 3.~~
Kuruma de DS can't load data on emulators, causing error 3.
Here are the other errors
## Save Errors
| ID  | String ID                       | Cause       |
| --- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | `GAMESAVE_ERR_CARD_CONNECT`     | Unknown     |
| 2   | `GAMESAVE_ERR_SAVE_OTHER`       | Unknown     |
| 3   | `GAMESAVE_ERR_CARD_CONNECT`     | Using an emulator     |
| 4/5 | `GAMESAVE_ERR_LOAD_DATA_BROKEN` | Unknown     |
| 6   | `GAMESAVE_ERR_LOAD_OLD_VERSION` | Unknown     |
| 7/8 | `GAMESAVE_ERR_SAVE_OTHER`       | Unknown     |

We can set r0 to an ID (i.e., 3 for `GAMESAVE_ERR_CARD_CONNECT`) while paused on `0204bd10` to get an arbitrary error message.
String ID `0x0` results in the following screen:

The text in brackets translates to "saving data"

## String ID table
This is a list of string IDs and what they translate to. ~~Kanji characters I can't read (most of them) are replaced with K?~~
Nevermind, I found Japanese OCR.

# The AVN-ZX02i
Denso-ten's flagship product (at the time). Came packaged with Kuruma de DS, and it's the main reason why we're here.

## Protocol
No clue. It must have some sort of indicator, because when a car is started and in bluetooth pairing mode in the vicinity of a DS running UZCJ, UZCJ picks it up, but then errors shortly after.
